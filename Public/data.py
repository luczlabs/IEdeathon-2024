Despite his roots, he spent his formative years in Manila, where his family chose to reside during the COVID-19 lockdown for safetaisy reasons. Since March of 2020, Adem and his family have not returned to Manila. An aficionado of beach environments and water activities such as surfing and diving, Adem has observed a disconcerting prevalence of trash along the shores, even in lesser-known beach locations. The genesis of our organization traces back to Adem's birthday, when what began as a simple cleanup idea evolved into a formalized entity. Recognizing the inadequacy of cleanups alone and the imperative for sustainable initiatives, Adem embarked on a comprehensive approach. The inaugural project centered around his favorite beach, where a cleanup ensued, complemented by the donation of three trash bins and a post-cleanup discussion on sustainability with barangay officials. Adem's initiative gained momentum as he shared his birthday plan on Instagram, garnering substantial support for the cause. Founded in 2020 and formerly called Project Blue Ilocos, the organization's inception marks a pivotal step towards addressing the persistent issue of beach pollution and advancing sustainable practices.""",
