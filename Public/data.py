Since March of 2020, Adem and his family have not returned to Manila. An aficionado of beach environments and water activities such as surfing and diving, Adem has observed a disconcerting prevalence of trash along the shores, even in lesser-known beach locations. The genesis of our organization traces back to Adem's birthday, when what began as a simple cleanup idea evolved into a formalized entity. Recognizing the inadequacy of cleanups alone and the imperative for sustainable initiatives, Adem embarked on a comprehensive approach. The inaugural project centered around his favorite beach, where a cleanup ensued, complemented by the donation of three trash bins and a post-cleanup discussion on sustainability with barangay officials. Adem's initiative gained momentum as he shared his birthday plan on Instagram, garnering substantial support for the cause. The organization's inception marks a pivotal step towards addressing the persistent issue of beach pollution and advancing sustainable practices.""",
